            <p>Through wrestling, participants learn key values such as resilience, discipline, commitment, leadership and sportsmanship.

            <p>Twin brothers, Khairy and Qayyum aged 15 are two examples of outgoing sporty teenagers who have benefitted from this programme. Although they love martial arts, they found pursuing such sports at commercial clubs unaffordable. After learning about the Beat The Streets program and inspired by their elder brother who wrestled for the National team, they signed up for it immediately. Their brother Hidayat, now aged 29, says that his twin brothers had many bad influences outside home but wrestling gave them something to focus on. Being able to afford training and equipment for the both of them would have been difficult but through BTS Singapore, the twins are now able to train regularly under qualified coaches in a safe environment and will even have the opportunity to represent our Nation one day.</p>

            <p>At another school in the western region of Singapore, students from an after-school program participate in the Beat The Streets program once a week. They are taught important moral values, life skills, and develop coordination and gross motor skills through learning skills like cartwheels and bear crawls, as well as useful wrestling and basic personal protection skills like how to fall safely. Through BTS Singapore’s partnership with other youth organisations such as Junior Achievement Singapore, the students are also taught entrepreneurial and wealth management skills on how to earn, save and donate money and to spend wisely. As one participant, Alisha (not her real name) has to say, "The activities are very fun and I have learnt important values such as teamwork, cooperation and how to respect one another like when we have to shake hands before and after a game".</p>
